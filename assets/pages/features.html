    <ul id="features">
      <li>
        High-Performance Sound Capture: The ClearHear Glasses are equipped with
        a highly sensitive, multi-directional microphone. This microphone is
        capable of picking up a wide range of sounds, from quiet conversations
        to louder public announcements, ensuring no important sound is missed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Advanced Noise-Cancellation Technology: Utilizing state-of-the-art
        noise-cancellation algorithms, the glasses can distinguish between the
        primary sound source (like speech) and background noise. This results in
        a clearer, more accurate conversion of speech to text.
      </li>
      <li>
        Real-Time Speech-to-Text Conversion: The core feature of ClearHear
        Glasses is the ability to convert speech to text instantly. This is
        achieved through sophisticated voice recognition software that can
        accurately transcribe spoken words into written text at an impressive
        speed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Language Translation and Support: The glasses support multiple
        languages, making them useful in various linguistic settings. If the
        speech is in a foreign language, the built-in translation module can
        translate it into the user's preferred language before converting it to
        text.
      </li>
      <li>
        Customizable Display Settings: The subtitles are displayed on a
        transparent, heads-up display on the glasses. Users can customize the
        appearance of these subtitles, including font size, color, and contrast,
        to ensure maximum readability and comfort.
      </li>
      <li>
        Intuitive User Interface: Through a connected mobile app, users can
        easily configure the settings of their glasses. This app allows for the
        adjustment of language settings, subtitle display options, and even the
        sensitivity of the microphone.
      </li>
      <li>
        Durable and Stylish Design: ClearHear Glasses are designed not only for
        functionality but also for style and durability. They resemble high-end
        fashion sunglasses and are built to withstand everyday use.
      </li>
      <li>
        UV Protection: The glasses also function as regular sunglasses,
        providing UV protection to the users. This feature makes them ideal for
        outdoor use.
      </li>
      <li>
        Battery Life and Eco-Friendly Charging: The glasses are equipped with a
        long-lasting battery, suitable for all-day use. They come with an
        eco-friendly charging solution, minimizing the environmental impact.
      </li>
      <li>
        Accessibility Features: Additional accessibility features include
        vibration alerts for notifications and the ability to connect with
        hearing aids for users who have partial hearingÂ ability.
