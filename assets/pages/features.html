        The ClearHear Glasses are equipped with a highly sensitive,
        multi-directional microphone. This microphone is capable of picking up a
        wide range of sounds, from quiet conversations to louder public
        announcements, ensuring no important sound is missed.

        >
        Utilizing state-of-the-art noise-cancellation algorithms, the glasses
        can distinguish between the primary sound source (like speech) and
        background noise. This results in a clearer, more accurate conversion of
        speech to text.

        The core feature of ClearHear Glasses is the ability to convert speech
        to text instantly. This is achieved through sophisticated voice
        recognition software that can accurately transcribe spoken words into
        written text at an impressive speed.

        The glasses support multiple languages, making them useful in various
        linguistic settings. If the speech is in a foreign language, the
        built-in translation module can translate it into the user's preferred
        language before converting it to text.
