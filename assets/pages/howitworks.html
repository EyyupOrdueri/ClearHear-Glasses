        <h2>How It Works:</h2>
        <p>
          <span style="color: #66ffff"><b>Sound Capture:</b></span> The
          innovative microphone located on the right side of the ClearHear
          Glasses is always active, ready to capture any sound in the wearer's
          environment. This includes conversations, announcements, and even
          distant sounds.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span style="color: #66ffff"
            ><b>Noise Filtering and Sound Processing:</b></span
          >
          The glasses feature advanced noise-cancellation technology. This
          system filters out background noise, ensuring only clear, distinct
          sounds are processed. The sophisticated sound processing software then
          converts these sounds into text.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span style="color: #66ffff"
            ><b>Real-Time Translation and Conversion:</b></span
          >

          If the captured sound is in a language different from the user's
          preset preference, the software translates it first. Then, the
          speech-to-text engine rapidly converts the spoken words into written
          subtitles.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span style="color: #66ffff"><b>Displaying Subtitles:</b></span>

          These subtitles are then projected onto the transparent display of the
          glasses in real-time. This display is strategically positioned to be
          easily readable without obstructing the wearer's view. Users can
          adjust the size, font, and color of the text for optimal readability.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span style="color: #66ffff"
            ><b>User Interface and Customization:</b></span
          >

          Users can interact with the glasses through a connected app, allowing
          them to customize settings such as language preferences, subtitle
          appearance, and volume of environmental sound capture. They can also
          navigate through past conversations, saved as text transcripts.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span style="color: #66ffff"><b>Battery and Charging:</b></span>

          The glasses are designed for extended use with a long-lasting battery.
          They can be easily charged via a USB-C port, ensuring they are ready
          for continuous, all-day use.
